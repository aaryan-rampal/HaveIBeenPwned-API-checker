Make a file named 'input.txt' with the SHA-1 hash of the passwords you'd like to check. Put only one hash on one line and don't leave any trailing spaces.

Compile and run 'MakeFile.java'. 

Then, run "chmod +x test.sh" to make the shell script executable and run the shell script.

Check the 'results_pwnedpasswords.txt' file to see which hash has been compromised and how many times.

Dependencies: 

Java (I tested it on 12 and it works)

grep (preinstalled for most Linux distributions)
